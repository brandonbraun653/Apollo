This set of Chimera drivers is for embedded systems that have a more extensive set of resources (DDRx, eMMC, etc). Normally these systems
could run something like Linux, but I want to try my hand at developing a system of my own that sits between resource constrained 
microcontrollers and full blown microprocessors running Linux.

 *
 * @section Introduction
 *
 * @subsection xxx Overview
 *
 * The Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) controller offers flexibility and
 * convenience by way of software configurable multipliers and
 * dividers to modify the clock input signal internally. The
 * resulting clock outputs are passed to the DSP core, peripherals
 * and other modules in the DSP.
 *
 * @subsection References
 *   -# PLLC User Guide.
 *
 * @subsection Assumptions
 *    The abbreviations PLLC, pllc and Pllc have been used throughout this
 *    document to refer to PLL Controller.

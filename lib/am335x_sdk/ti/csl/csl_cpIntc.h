/** @defgroup CSL_CPINTC_API CPINTC
 *
 * @section Introduction
 *
 * @subsection xxx Overview
 *  The CPINTC is the interrupt controller which handles the system interrupts
 *  for the host, processes & prioritizes them and then is responsible for 
 *  delivering these to the host.
 *
 * @subsection References
 *   -# CPINTC Architecture Specification.
 *
 * @subsection Assumptions
 *    The abbreviations CPINTC, cpintc have been used throughout this
 *    document to refer to Interrupt Controller.

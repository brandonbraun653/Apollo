/** @defgroup CSL_MPU_API MPU
 *
 * @section Introduction
 *  The MPU performs memory protection checking for a CBA bus. It inputs a VBUSM 
 *  or VBUSP bus, checks the address against the fixed and programmable regions 
 *  to see if the access is allowed. If allowed the transfer is passed unmodified
 *  to the output VBUSM or VBUSP bus. If the transfer is illegal (fails the 
 *  protection check) then the MPU does not pass the transfer to the output bus 
 *  but rather services the transfer internally back to the input bus (to prevent
 *  a hang) returning the fault status to the requestor as well as generating an 
 *  interrupt about the fault.

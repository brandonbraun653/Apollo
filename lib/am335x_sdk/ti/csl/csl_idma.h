 * @section Introduction
 *
 * @subsection xxx Overview
 *
 * The iDMA is a simple DMA engine that can be used to perform block transfers 
 * between any two memory locations local to the GEM. A "local" memory is simply
 * one whose controller is inside the GEM, which can be L1P, L1D, L2 (port A and
 * port B), or peripheral configuration port (CFG). The iDMA controller allows 
 * rapid data paging between all local memories. To fully support this, the iDMA
 * consists of two orthogonal channels caoable of working concurrently. The two
 * channels are:
 *      a) IDMA Channel 0:- Intended for quick programming of configuration 
 *         registers through external CFG port of GEM.
 *      b) IDMA Channel 1:- Intended for data paging between local memories.  
 *
 * @subsection References
 *   -# GEM Internal DMA (IDMA) Specification. 
 *
 * @subsection Assumptions
 *    The abbreviations IDMA, idma and Idma have been used throughout this
 *    document to refer to iDMA Controller.

/**
 *  \ingroup PM_HAL PM HAL API
 *  \addtogroup PM_HAL_VM
 *
 *  The Power Management IC (PMIC) Manager is used to set and read back the
 *  voltage on the voltage rails of the System on Chip (SoC) through its
 *  interaction with the external PMIC on the board via I2C.
 *  The VM uses the HAL abstraction provided by the PMIC Manager to set a
 *  given voltage domain to a desired voltage.
 *  The PMIC API would not retain any state which would record the voltage/OPP
 *  setting for a given regulator that it is programming. The only state
 *  maintained at the PMIC HAL would be the function pointers populated on the
 *  PMIC registration.
 *
 *  The PMIC APIs do not work independently. They need to be populated with
 *  the right PMIC operation functions (using function pointers) by the
 *  application to achieve the desired operation.
 * @{

 *  \brief This file contains the PMIC API.
 *         The PMIC API provides a generic PMIC interface to the users while
 *         abstracting the different PMIC HW. A user can bind a specific
 *         PMIC HW to this PMIC interface by registering the
 *         pmhalPmicOperations_t type with the PMIC module.

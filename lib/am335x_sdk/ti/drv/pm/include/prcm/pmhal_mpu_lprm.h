 *         The MPU LPRM API supports the following features:
 *         - Mercury Retention Enable.
 *         - Mercury Retention Ramp Up enable + Corresponding ramp time.
 *         - Set the power state of the CPU.
 *         - Read the power status of the CPU.
 *         - Set the clock state of the CPU.
 *         - Read the standby status of the CPU.
 *
 *  \note   The reset capability of MPU LPRM is handled in the Reset
 *          Manager HAL.

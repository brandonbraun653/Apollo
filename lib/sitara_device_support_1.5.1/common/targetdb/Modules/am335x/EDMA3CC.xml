  <register acronym="QER" description="The QDMA event register (QER) channel n bit is set (En = 1) when the CPU or any EDMA3 programmer (including EDMA3) performs a write to the trigger word (using the QDMA channel mapping register (QCHMAPn)) in the PaRAM entry associated with QDMA channel n (which is also programmed using QCHMAPn). The En bit is also set when the EDMA3CC performs a link update on a PaRAM address that matches the QCHMAPn settings. The QDMA event is latched only if the QDMA event enable register (QEER) channel n bit is also enabled (QEER.En = 1). Once a bit is set in QER, then the corresponding QDMA event (auto-trigger) is evaluated by the EDMA3CC logic for an associated transfer request submission to the transfer controllers. For additional conditions that can lead to the setting of QER bits, see EDMA Overview. The setting of an event is a higher priority relative to clear operations (via hardware). If set and clear conditions occur concurrently, the set condition wins. If the event was previously set, then the QDMA event missed register (QEMR) would be set because an event is lost. If the event was previously clear, then the event remains set and is prioritized for submission to the event queues. The set bits in QER are only cleared when the transfer request associated with the corresponding channels has been processed by the EDMA3CC and submitted to the transfer controller. If the En bit is already set and a QDMA event for the same QDMA channel occurs prior to the original being cleared, then the second missed event is latched in QEMR (En = 1). QER is part of a set of register that control the QDMA channels in EDMA3CC. QDMA channels (with the exception of the QDMA queue number register) consist of a set of registers, each of which have a bit location. Each bit position corresponds to a QDMA channel number.

Depending on the condition that lead to the setting of the QSER bits, either the EDMA3CC hardware or the software (using QSECR) needs to clear the QSER bits for the EDMA3CC to evaluate subsequent QDMA events on the channel.

  <register acronym="RTC_CTRL_REG" description="The RTC_CTRL_REG contains the controls to enable/disable the RTC, set the 12/24 hour time mode, to enable the 30 second rounding feature, and to STOP/START the RTC. The SET_32_COUNTER bit must only be used when the RTC is frozen. The RTC_DISABLE bit must only be used to completely disable the RTC function. When this bit is set, the 32 kHz clock is gated and the RTC is frozen. From this point, resetting this bit to zero can lead to unexpected behavior. This bit should only be used if the RTC function is unwanted in the application, in order to save power. MODE_12_24: It is possible to switch between the two modes at any time without disturbing the RTC. Read or write is always performed with the current mode. Auto compensation is enabled by the AUTO_COMP bit. If the COMP_REG value is positive, compensation occurs after the second change event. COMP_REG cycles are removed from the next second. If the COMP_REG value is negative, compensation occurs before the second change event. COMP_REG cycles are added to the current second. This enables it to compensate with one 32-kHz period accuracy each hour. The ROUND_30S bit is a toggle bit; the ARM can only write 1 and the RTC clears it. If the ARM sets the ROUND_30S bit and then reads it, the ARM reads 1 until the round-to-the-closest-minute is performed at the next second. The ARM can stop the RTC by clearing the STOP_RTC bit (owing to internal resynchronization, the RUN bit of the status register (STATUS_REG) must be checked to ensure that the RTC is frozen), then update TC values, and re-start the RTC by resetting the STOP_RTC bit." id="RTC_CTRL_REG" offset="0x40" width="32">

ALARM2: This bit will indicate the status of the alarm interrupt. Writing a 1 to the bit clears the interrupt. ALARM: This bit will indicate the status of the alarm interrupt. Writing a 1 to the bit clears the interrupt. 1D_EVENT1: This bit will indicate if a day event has occurred.
